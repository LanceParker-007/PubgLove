Hello viewer, I created this site to develop my Bootstrap skills and show my love for PUBG Mobile India ❤.
This is the original Site :- https://www.pubgmobile.in/ .
And this is my Bootstrap version :- https://lanceparker-007.github.io/PubgLove/ .

If you also love PUBG and if you find my site a good copy, then thank you for appreciating my work.

Points to noted : (These points are now not useful, since I updated the site)
1-> Alert : Don't click on support link.
2-> There is onmouseover on support link.
3-> If you have opened the support and you are hurt then I'm sorry.
